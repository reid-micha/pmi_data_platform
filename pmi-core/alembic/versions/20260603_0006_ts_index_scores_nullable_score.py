"""Make ts_index_scores.score nullable so the pipeline can persist
"no score this tick" without leaving a stale value visible.

Backports Micah PR #316 / micah-job-executor PR #12 (2026-05-28), where
the bug was countries dropping below ``MIN_CONTRACTS`` keeping the last
computed PMI (Nigeria stuck at 76.5). On this platform the equivalent
trigger is ``len(collapsed) < ir.aggregation.min_components`` or zero
weighted relevancy across components — both now flow through as
``score=NULL`` rather than ``0.0``.
