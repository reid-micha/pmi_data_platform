"""Detect & collapse mutually-exclusive bucket markets.

Polymarket (and other prediction venues) frequently split a single question
into daily / weekly / multi-year deadline buckets:

    "Will the US strike Iran on June 20, 2026?"
    "Will the US strike Iran on June 21, 2026?"
    "Will Ethiopia bring a 5th-gen fighter into service by the end of 2030?"
    "Will Ethiopia bring a 5th-gen fighter into service by the end of 2035?"

These are mutually exclusive — only one outcome can occur. Treating each
as an independent component double-counts the underlying event and skews
the aggregated PMI. This module detects such groups and replaces all
members with a single synthetic row whose price is the *combined*
probability:

  * **Calendar buckets** (≥ 2 parseable dates within `max_spread_days`):
    noisy-OR aggregation, ``p = 1 - Π (1 - p_i)`` — correct under the
    independence approximation.
  * **Multi-year / undated deadline variants** (no two parseable dates
    within the window — e.g. "by end of 2030" vs "by end of 2040"):
    arithmetic mean — neither sum-capped nor noisy-OR are appropriate
    because the deadlines aren't independent events.

Ported from Micah's `micah-job-executor/.../bucket_collapser.py`
(2026-05-29 — PR #15 "noisy-OR + mean"). Adapted for the platform's
`MarketEvaluations` shape (no `source` dimension — Polymarket-only —
and the per-index `max_spread_days` lives in `CollapseSpec`).
