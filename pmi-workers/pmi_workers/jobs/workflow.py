"""`workflow` job — executes a durable workflow run (CORR-8.1).

The queue job is the execution vehicle; durability lives in pmi-core's
checkpointing (``core_workflow_steps``). A raised exception here triggers the
queue's backoff retry, and the next execution replays from the last completed
step — that combination IS the Temporal-replacement contract.
